            <h3>Othello</h3>
            <p>I loved this game growing up, and thought it'd be a good project to practice my JavaScript skills on. It is actually possible to change the number of squares on the board, so I need to add in a player control to set that, as well as a way to restart the game. I also want to make an AI player, possibly using machine learning.</p>
