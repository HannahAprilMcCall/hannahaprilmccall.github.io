        <p>Hello! My name is Hannah, and I make stuff.</p>
        <p>I graduated from Westminster University with a 1st in Contemporary
          media practice in 2012, and have been working in the media industry
          ever since.</p>
        <p>I am currently studying computing and IT, taking a software development path. 
          I found myself working more and more with code (starting with expressions in After
          effects) and wanted to build on my skills. It helps that I absolutely love it!
        </p>
        <p>On this website you'll find a range of projects that I've worked on.
